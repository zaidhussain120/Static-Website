                    - It's a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development.

                    - PHP code is embedded within HTML, allowing dynamic content generation 
                      on web pages.

                    - PHP scripts are executed on the server, generating HTML that is sent to
                      the client's browser.

                    - PHP supports various databases, making it suitable for building database-driven
                       web applications.

                    - It offers a wide range of built-in functions for tasks such as string
                      manipulation , file handling, and database interaction.

                    - PHP can be used to create web forms, process form data, and interact with web servers.

                    - It's open-source and widely used, powering a significant portion of websites on the internet.

                <pre>
                     - PHP is crucial for dynamic and interactive web page creation through 
                       server-side scripting.

                       platforms like WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia.

                     - Its simplicity in syntax makes it accessible to developers of varying 
                       skill levels.

                     - Being open-source encourages community collaboration, driving ongoing 
                       improvement and innovation.

                       generation, database interaction, form processing, and session management.

                     - Seamless integration with various databases facilitates database-driven
                        web applications.
                     - A rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, such as Laravel and Symfony, 
                       accelerates development and maintains code quality.

        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            Weak maps were added in PHP 8. A WeakMap holds references to objects, but these references do not prevent such objects from being garbage collected.[84] This can provide performance improvements in scenarios where data is being cached; this is of particular relevance for objectâ€“relational mappings (ORM).[72]
            Various adjustments to interfaces, such as adding support for creating DateTime objects from interfaces, and the addition of a Stringable interface that can be used for type hinting.[citation needed]
            Various new functions including str_contains(), str_starts_with(), and str_ends_with();[85] fdiv(); get_debug_type(); and get_resource_id()[citation needed]
