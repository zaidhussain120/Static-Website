                <h2 class="text-center">1. what is HTML</h2>
                <pre>

                    - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

                    - It's the standard markup language used for creating 
                       and structuring web pages and web applications.

                    - HTML documents consist of a series of elements or tags
                      that define the structure and content of a webpage.

                    - Elements are enclosed in angle brackets , and typically 
                      come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.

                    - Tags can contain attributes, providing additional information
                       about the element.

                    - HTML elements are organized in a hierarchical structure,
                       forming the DOM (Document Object Model) of a webpage.

                    - HTML allows embedding various types of content, such as 
                      text, images, links, videos, and forms.

                    - It provides semantic elements for indicating the meaning
                      and purpose of different parts of a webpage, enhancing
                      accessibility and SEO.

                <h2 class="text-center">2. Why HTML is Important</h2>
                <pre>
                    - HTML forms the backbone of web pages, providing structure and content for
                      displaying information on the internet.

                    - It is a standardized language recognized by browsers, ensuring compatibility
                      across various platforms and devices.

                    - HTML content is universally accessible, enabling anyone with an internet 
                      connection and a web browser to access information.

                    - Proper HTML usage aids in search engine optimization (SEO), improving the
                      discoverability and ranking of web content in search results.

                    - HTML facilitates the creation of user-friendly web pages with clear navigation,
                      readable content, and accessible media, enhancing the overall user experience.

                    - It seamlessly integrates with other web technologies like CSS and JavaScript, 
                      enabling rich and dynamic web experiences.

                    - HTML supports embedding multimedia content such as images, videos, and audio, 
                      allowing for engaging and interactive web pages.

                    - With features like responsive design and mobile-friendly elements introduced in 
                      HTML5, web pages can adapt to different screen sizes and devices, including
                      smartphones and tablets.

        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. History of HTML</h2>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, has a rich history that parallels the evolution of the World Wide Web.
            It originated in the late 1980s when physicist Tim Berners-Lee envisioned a way to share information among
            researchers at CERN. In 1991, he introduced the concept of HTML along with the first web browser and web
            server. Initially, HTML was simple, consisting mainly of basic tags for formatting text and linking
            documents. As the web grew in popularity, the need for more advanced features became apparent, leading to
            the development of HTML 2.0 in 1995, which introduced new capabilities like forms and tables.

            The mid-1990s marked a period of rapid innovation and expansion for HTML. Netscape Communications, a leading
            browser developer at the time, introduced tags and features not present in the original specification. This
            led to fragmentation in the web standards landscape, with different browsers supporting different features.
            To address this issue, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 to standardize HTML and other
            web technologies. HTML 3.2, released in 1997, was the first standardized version of HTML, bringing
            consistency and interoperability to the web.

            Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, HTML continued to evolve with the introduction of HTML 4.01,
            which added support for multimedia elements and improved accessibility features. However, the web was still
            primarily static, consisting of documents linked together with hyperlinks. This changed with the advent of
            Web 2.0 in the mid-2000s, which emphasized dynamic, interactive web applications. HTML 5, introduced in
            2014, addressed this shift by adding new elements and APIs for multimedia, graphics, and interactivity. It
            also introduced semantic elements for better document structure and accessibility.

            Today, HTML remains the cornerstone of web development, providing the foundation for creating and
            structuring web pages and applications. Its continued evolution, along with advancements in CSS and
            JavaScript, ensures that the web remains a vibrant and innovative platform for sharing information and
            building digital experiences.
