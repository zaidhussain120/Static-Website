                <h2 class="text-center">1. what is Java</h2>
                <pre>
                    - Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language.

                    - It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle
                       Corporation) and released in 1995.
                       
                    - Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle,
                       meaning code written in Java can run on any device with a (JVM).

                    - It is platform-independent, making it suitable for developing 
                      applications for various operating systems, including Windows, 
                      macOS, Linux, and mobile platforms like Android.

                    - Java applications are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed
                      on any JVM, providing portability across different platforms.

                    - It is widely used for building web applications, mobile apps, desktop
                      applications, enterprise software, and embedded systems.

                    - Java offers extensive standard libraries for common tasks, as well as a 
                      rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks.

                <h2 class="text-center">2. Why Java is Important</h2>
                <pre>
                    - Java's "write once, run anywhere" principle allows for cross-platform 
                    compatibility, enabling Java programs to run on any device with a (JVM).

                    - Its versatility spans across web, mobile, desktop, enterprise, and 
                     embedded systems development, making it a crucial tool in various domains.

                    - Java's scalability accommodates applications of all sizes, from small-scale 
                      projects to large enterprise systems.

                    - A vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools streamlines development, 
                      reducing time-to-market and improving application quality.

                    - The large and active Java community provides extensive support, resources,
                       and knowledge sharing opportunities.
                    - Built-in security features like bytecode verification and sandboxing make   
                      Java a preferred choice for building secure applications.

                    - Java's maturity ensures stability and reliability, crucial for mission-critical
                      applications.

        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. OOPS in Java</h2>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which
            are instances of classes. Java's OOP features provide a structured approach to software development,
            facilitating modular, reusable, and maintainable code. In Java, OOP principles are manifested through
            encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods
            within a class, allowing for data hiding and protecting the internal state of objects. Inheritance enables
            the creation of new classes (subclasses) based on existing ones (superclasses), promoting code reuse and
            establishing hierarchical relationships. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their
            parent class, facilitating flexibility and code extensibility. Abstraction focuses on modeling real-world
            entities by emphasizing essential characteristics while hiding implementation details. Together, these OOP
            principles in Java empower developers to design and implement complex systems efficiently, fostering
            modularity, maintainability, and scalability in software projects.
