        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            "CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
            In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the
            markup itself.

            Selector types
            Selectors may apply to the following:

            all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
            elements specified by attribute, in particular:
            id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id
            class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g.
            .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified
            with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the
            related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the
            "class" system of the Web content model)
            elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
            Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens,
            and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to a
            single element.
